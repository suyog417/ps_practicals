Step 1: Hypothesis Formulation
Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses for the t-test based on the research question or objective.

Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean weight of the turtles is equal to 310 pounds.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The mean weight of the turtles is not equal to 310 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the Test Statistic
The test statistic for a t-test is calculated using the formula:

t = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (sample standard deviation / √n)

Given:
Sample size (n) = 40
Sample mean weight = 300
Sample standard deviation (s) = 18.5
Hypothesized mean weight = 310

Substituting these values into the formula, we have:

t = (300 - 310) / (18.5 / √40)
= -10 / (18.5 / 6.325)
= -10 / 2.93
= -3.41 (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 3: Determine the Degrees of Freedom
The degrees of freedom (df) for the t-test are calculated as (n - 1).

Given:
Sample size (n) = 40

Degrees of Freedom (df) = 40 - 1 = 39

Step 4: Determine the Critical Value
Look up the critical value for the chosen significance level (alpha) and degrees of freedom (df) in 
the t-distribution table. 
Let''s assume a significance level of 0.05 for this example.

For a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05 and df = 39, the critical value is approximately ±2.023 
(rounded to three decimal places).

Step 5: Calculate the p-value
Using the test statistic (-3.41) and the degrees of freedom (39),
 we can calculate the p-value associated with the t-value. 
 The p-value represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the observed value 
 (or more extreme) under the null hypothesis.

To calculate the p-value, we can refer to statistical software or consult t-distribution tables. 
For this example, the p-value is less than 0.001 (very small), indicating a highly significant result.

Step 6: Make a Decision
Compare the p-value with the chosen significance level (alpha) to make a decision regarding the null hypothesis.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. 
In this case, since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis 
and conclude that the mean weight of the turtles is not equal to 310 pounds.
